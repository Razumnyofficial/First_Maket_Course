            How the Rise of Soccer in the US <br />Is Changing the Face of Youth

              The focus on soccer in youth sports <br />
              programs is exploding nation-wide
            </h2>
            <hr />
            <p class="info">
              When the first World Cup arrived in the US in the 90's everyone
              officially declared that soccer was it. Well it's taken it's time
              but we can definitely see the influence of soccer, especially
              women's soccer, across the US. This year, 3 million kids played in
              youth soccer leagues with 2/3 of those leagues for girls. In fact,
              in the 12-17 age range the MLS has surpassed the MLB and NFL in
              popularity.
            </p>
            <p class="info">
              Part of this meteoric rise can be attributed to the impressively
              soaring ad dollars being pumped into the Women's World Cup games
              in 2014. The women's games generated $40 million for Fox, that's
              definitely not chump change. And those advertisers, like ATT, Coca
              Cola, Verizon, Nike, Visa, and other heavy hitters, are working to
              make sure they see those numbers grow year after year by investing
              in youth soccer facilities and promoting
            </p>
            <p class="info last">
              Now that big business is involved you can be assured you'll see a
              continued rise in popularity in soccer across the country for
              years to come.
